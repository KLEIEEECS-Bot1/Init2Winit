# Implementation Plan

## Blockchain Integration Strategy

**Current Phase (Phase 1)**: The initial implementation uses a traditional database-based token system with MongoDB. This provides immediate functionality while preparing the foundation for Solidity smart contract integration on Polygon network.

**Future Phase (Phase 2)**: The system is designed to be Polygon blockchain-ready, meaning:
- Token transactions include placeholder fields for Polygon blockchain transaction hashes
- Wallet interfaces are designed to accommodate Web3 wallet connections (MetaMask with Polygon network)
- Token data structures are compatible with ERC-20 token standards for Polygon deployment
- API endpoints can be extended to interact with Solidity smart contracts on Polygon network
- Smart contract architecture prepared for reward token minting and task verification

**Benefits of this approach**:
- Immediate deployment without blockchain complexity or gas fees
- Lower transaction costs when migrating to Polygon (compared to Ethereum mainnet)
- Easy migration path to Solidity smart contracts when ready
- Familiar user experience while maintaining future Polygon Web3 compatibility
