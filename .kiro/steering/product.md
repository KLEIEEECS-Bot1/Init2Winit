# Product Overview

## Event-Based Volunteer Reward System

A gamified volunteer management platform that incentivizes community participation through a token-based reward system. The application connects organizers who need volunteer work completed with volunteers who earn tokens for their contributions.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Volunteers**: Earn tokens by completing tasks, progress through skill levels, and compete on leaderboards
- **For Organizers**: Create and manage volunteer tasks, verify completions, and track engagement

### Key Features
- Role-based authentication (organizer/volunteer)
- Progressive skill-based task unlocking (beginner → intermediate → advanced)
- Token economy with tiered rewards (10/25/50 tokens)
- Gamification elements (leaderboards, progress tracking, badges)
- Future blockchain integration on Polygon network

### User Roles
- **Volunteer**: Browse tasks, earn tokens, track progress, compete on leaderboards
- **Organizer**: Create tasks, verify completions, monitor volunteer engagement

### Token Economy
- Easy tasks: 10 tokens (beginner level)
- Intermediate tasks: 25 tokens (unlocked after 5 easy tasks)
- Difficult tasks: 50 tokens (unlocked after 10 total tasks)

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core system with authentication, task management, and token wallet
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced features, real-time updates, comprehensive testing
3. **Phase 3**: Blockchain integration with Solidity smart contracts and MetaMask
